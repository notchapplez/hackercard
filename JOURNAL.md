## 10/12/2025 11 AM - Finished the pcb, got excited  

Followed the tutorial @ jams.hackclub.com, followed the schematic instructions, designed the unique pcb, drew a cute bongo cat in gimp, placed it on the pcb, made its  left paw light up, exported the gerbers, checked everything and got excited that I will maybe get this cute card :3

## 10/19/2025 - Made a horrific case  

Well...
I tried to make a case. Looks fine to me. Has slots on the sides to make the outer cards easier to take out. Should be perfect size. Didn't realize it took me 2 HOURS to get something. Should be good enough for this. And if you wanna take a look at it, here ya go:
