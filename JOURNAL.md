## 10/12/2025 11 AM - Finished the pcb, got excited  

Followed the tutorial @ jams.hackclub.com, followed the schematic instructions, designed the unique pcb, drew a cute bongo cat in gimp, placed it on the pcb, made its  left paw light up, exported the gerbers, checked everything and got excited that I will maybe get this cute card :3
